## Objective


The objectives were to develop a robust malware detection system leveraging trie data structure, implementing both backend and frontend components, ensuring integration and scalability, and conducting thorough testing and evaluation.

### Skills Learned


- Data Structures and Algorithms: Proficiency gained in designing algorithms for malware signature management and file scanning.
- Python Programming: Enhanced skills covering backend development, GUI creation, file handling, and algorithm implementation.
- Object-Oriented Design: Mastery of principles for creating modular and reusable code structures.
- GUI Development with Tkinter: Expertise acquired in creating intuitive and visually appealing interfaces.
- Cybersecurity Practices: Skills developed in understanding common attack patterns and defensive strategies.

### Tools Used


- Python: Primary programming language for backend and frontend development due to versatility and extensive libraries.
- Tkinter: Utilized for GUI development, offering tools and widgets for interactive interfaces.
- PyMuPDF and python-pptx: Used for handling PDF, PPTX, and DOCX file formats, facilitating text extraction for scanning.


## Setup Guide

1. **Check Python Installation:**
   - Ensure Python is installed on your computer by running `python --version` in your terminal or command prompt. If Python is not installed, download and install it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Packages:**
   - Install the necessary Python packages for the project:
     ```bash
     pip install PyMuPDF
     pip install python-pptx
     pip install python-docx
     ```

3. **Clone the Project Repository:**
   - Clone the project repository from GitHub using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone <https://github.com/nipun-priyanjith/malware-detection.git>
     ```

4. **Run the Project:**
   - Navigate to the project directory and run the main Python script:
     ```bash
     cd <project_directory>
     python main.py
     ```
