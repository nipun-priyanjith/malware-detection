## Objective


The objectives were to develop a robust malware detection system leveraging trie data structure, implementing both backend and frontend components, ensuring integration and scalability, and conducting thorough testing and evaluation.

### Skills Learned


- Data Structures and Algorithms: Proficiency gained in designing algorithms for malware signature management and file scanning.
- Python Programming: Enhanced skills covering backend development, GUI creation, file handling, and algorithm implementation.
- Object-Oriented Design: Mastery of principles for creating modular and reusable code structures.
- GUI Development with Tkinter: Expertise acquired in creating intuitive and visually appealing interfaces.
- Cybersecurity Practices: Skills developed in understanding common attack patterns and defensive strategies.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Python: Primary programming language for backend and frontend development due to versatility and extensive libraries.
- Tkinter: Utilized for GUI development, offering tools and widgets for interactive interfaces.
- PyMuPDF and python-pptx: Used for handling PDF, PPTX, and DOCX file formats, facilitating text extraction for scanning.
